# -MGH-Patient-Care-Performance-Dashboard-Strategic-Insights-for-Operational-Excellence
## Description
This project analyzes patient admission, readmission, length of stay, cost per visit, and insurance coverage data for Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) to create an executive-level KPI dashboard. The goal is to enable data-driven decision-making for improving operational efficiency, financial planning, and patient care quality.

## Project Overview
### Business Problem
MGHâ€™s executive team lacks real-time visibility into critical patient care metrics, hindering its ability to optimize resource allocation, reduce costs, and improve patient outcomes. Rising readmission rates and inconsistent insurance coverage further complicate financial sustainability.

### Objective

- Quantify patient admission/readmission trends over time.
- Calculate average patient length of stay (ALOS).
- Determine the average cost per visit and cost drivers.
- Analyze insurance coverage for procedures.
- Build a scalable dashboard for ongoing monitoring.
### Target Audience

#### Hospital Executives: 
Strategic planning and budget allocation.
#### Clinical Teams: 
Identify care inefficiencies impacting readmissions.
#### Finance Department: 
Track cost per visit and reimbursement trends.
#### Insurance Coordinators: 
Optimize coverage negotiations.

15% readmission rate (above the national average of 12%).
#### Length of Stay: 
Average LOS = 4.2 days; surgical patients stay 2.5x longer.
#### Cost per Visit: 
$3,500 average cost; 22% variance due to ICU utilization.
#### Insurance Coverage: 
78% of procedures covered; 12% denied claims due to coding errors.
### Impact

- Reducing readmissions by 3% could save $1.2M annually.
- Optimizing LOS for surgical patients may free up 150 bed days/month.
